# documentationRequest

I need documentation!

I have 148 repositories on github, and they're mostly underdocumented.

I need content I can syndicate to promote my various pieces of work in automation, crypto, blockchain, and stuff like social hacks.

I tried to sell one of my repos to these guys http://dexarb.rocks because their site appears to not have any functional tools, but didn't get much interest. I think I may have had if I had better documentation.

Here's what I wrote them:

Hey, any admin want to write me? I have a github repository conveniently called 'dexArb' that I just made private (although it already has 4 forks, last I worked on it was 6 or 7 months ago).

I'm willing to sell it for an appropriate price.

It's a ready-built solution that utilizes totle's dex aggreagating service in initial commits and later 0x's relayer's api to integrate with uniswap, kyber, 0x, and a bunch of exchanges while allowing faster and more accurate price discovery. This is incredibly important to dexArb because it took maybe 3 minutes to discover prices for a dozen or a few dozen token trading routes on Totle, which on 0x' api only takes a few seconds.. meaning there's more opportunities to act on, in less time, and we can find the most lucrative opportunities rather than relying on luck :)

I chose off-chain because it allows for iteriative development and allows the ability to make core changes without worrying about immutability.
